pvPortMalloc() is called internally by the kernel whenever a task, queue,timer or semaphore is created. It is also called by various parts of the demo application.
If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in 
FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used to

If the application makes use of the vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also important that 
vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling function,
